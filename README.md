# hello-world
hello and salam, i am reading the github guide that they suggest when you start an account, and they tell me to tell a bit about myself. so here it goes. my name is Ezzeddine i am 26 years old from Algeria, i want to learn the tools that able me to make the most of the means that i have right now, which is a computer and internet and some time. i like to learn and do things that eventually have good impact on the chain that i s society and the world in general. as i see it better than not doing anything or making things worse...this got a bit out off topic so i am going to try to steer it back on by telling you that i am starting to learn Python "in chae Allah" and if this would get to anyone any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated and i'll do my best to return the favor. thank you. peace
